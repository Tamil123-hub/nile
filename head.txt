Got it — if Git **still isn’t picking up** your username and email even after setting them, let’s fix this step-by-step carefully (this happens sometimes on Windows).

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Fix for “Git not getting my username and email”

### ✅ Step 1: Check where Git is looking for config files

Run these commands:

```bash
git config --show-origin --list
```

This shows **which file** each setting comes from — global, local, or system.
Look for something like this:

```
file:C:/Users/Tamilarasu/.gitconfig
file:C:/path/to/your/repo/.git/config
```

If `user.name` and `user.email` don’t appear in either, we’ll fix that next.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Manually add your name & email to the global config file

1. Open this file in Notepad:

   ```
   C:\Users\Tamilarasu\.gitconfig
   ```

2. If the file doesn’t exist, create it.

3. Add these lines:

   ```ini
   [user]
       name = Tamilarasu
       email = tamilarasu@gmail.com
   ```

4. Save the file and close Notepad.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Verify that Git reads your info

Run:

```bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

If both show your name and email correctly, great — move on.

---

### ✅ Step 4: If still not working, try setting *locally* in the repo

Go inside your repository folder and run:

```bash
git config user.name "Tamilarasu"
git config user.email "tamilarasu@gmail.com"
```

Then confirm:

```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

They should print correctly.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Try committing again

```bash
git commit -m "Inserting a new file"
```

You should no longer see “Author identity unknown”.

---

### ⚠️ Optional check — permission or path issues

If you still have trouble:

* Make sure Git is installed in your system PATH (`git --version` should work).
* Run Git Bash **as Administrator** once and re-run the commands above.
* Check that your Windows username doesn’t contain special characters that break Git paths.

---

Can you please run this and share the output?

```bash
git config --show-origin --list
```

That will tell me *exactly* which config file Git is using, so I can pinpoint the issue precisely.
